# Clemson University Fix It

An application where people in Clemson can go to report any feedback they have about the university. They can see issues with facilities
like a broken light, broken water fountain and then report it to the University Facilities for maintaince through one single application.
They could also use it to give feedback to the univerity for things like making a building more accessible by attaching an image and description
about the issue and submitting it to the accessibility counsil for work. 

Work in progress for the CU HackIt hackathon.
